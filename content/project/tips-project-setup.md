## Where to start?

* Visit the [Project Ideas][] page for a listing of resources to investigate and get your thoughts flowing.
* Visit the Udacity [NLP nanodegree project][] to review what you've learned in the course.
* Check out the [Projects Team] discussion board and start tossing around some questions and ideas.
* It will depend on your goals as to what you need and how to monitor your results. Do you want to do some basic experiments? That's might be a good place to start. Do you have a team of ambitious and experienced inventors? Some planning may be in order. 

## Plan, experiment, monitor

* What infrastructure and tools? Is your project going to take a cluster of GPUs and a billion data records? Or can it be run on a laptop? Visit the [Project Resources] page to help in the planning.

## Communicating progress and outcomes
* We invite you to discuss, annotate, document, or [blog] about your project in order to share it with other members. Inspire others and draw interest to your current and future projects! Remember, we're here to continue learning and learning from each other.
