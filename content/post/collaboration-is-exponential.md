Welcome to CommonPlace.world! Our paths may be similar in fundamental ways as we explore a changing world—one getting smaller in terms of our ability to communicate, yet one that's expanding with ideas and invention. We also likely have backgrounds and experiences that are very different, giving us unique perspectives and insights on the world.

Here we have opportunity to combine our insights, our learning, and our interests to build projects we might otherwise not attempt, at least not yet, nor progress as far, were it not for the inspiring thought or latent expectation from team members.

> When we collaborate, creativity unfolds across people; the sparks fly faster, and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
> —Keith Sawyer, *Group Genius: The Creative Power of Collaboration*

The effect of collaboration is not linear, it is exponential. Even posing a question about the purpose of doing something one way as opposed to another has value in casting light on shared knowledge and reasoning. Many brains expand ideas, and growth results from insights gained through group effort and experiment.
