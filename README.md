# CommonPlace Hugo Theme

This is a Hugo theme that will be used for the organization's website

The first time you clone the repo, you need to set up the submodule of the public repo.

To automate this task, run the following command:

```bash
. submodule-setup-script.sh
```

To deploy, run the following command

```bash
. deploy.sh
```

If you get a permissions denied error, change the permissions with this command

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
```
