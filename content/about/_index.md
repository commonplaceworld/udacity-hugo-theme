The effect of collaboration is not linear, it is exponential. CommonPlace.world is a space for people from all over to collaborate on projects together. The Udacity NLP nanodegree course content is our first and current focus. Here we can continue to experiment and grow our NLP knowledge. Check out our list of projects, or propose one of your own, join a team, and letâ€™s work together!
